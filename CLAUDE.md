# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository aims to convert the "Agentic-Design-Patterns" book into a functional application. The project is currently in its initial state and requires fundamental setup and architectural decisions.

## Current Project State

As of the last update, this is a greenfield project with:
- Initial git repository connected to: https://github.com/wjlgatech/Agentic-Design-Patterns-book2app.git
- Minimal file structure (README.md and this CLAUDE.md)
- No technology stack chosen yet
- No development environment configured

## Development Approach

When setting up this project, consider:
1. The nature of "Agentic-Design-Patterns" content and how it should be presented as an application
2. Whether this will be a web app, desktop app, or mobile app
3. Interactive elements that would enhance the book's concepts
4. How to structure the book's patterns into navigable, actionable components

## Future Development Guidelines

Once the technology stack is chosen, this file should be updated with:
- Specific build and development commands
- Testing frameworks and commands
- Project architecture and key directories
- Code conventions specific to the chosen stack
- Deployment procedures

For now, focus on understanding the requirements and making initial architectural decisions before proceeding with implementation.
