# Core dependencies for docx to markdown conversion
# Python 3.7+ required

# No external dependencies required!
# The conversion script uses only Python standard library modules:
# - pathlib: For path operations
# - zipfile: For extracting .docx files
# - xml.etree.ElementTree: For parsing XML content
# - hashlib: For generating unique image filenames
# - shutil: For file operations
# - os, sys, re: Standard utilities

# If you want to extend the converter with additional features, you might consider:
# python-docx==0.8.11  # Alternative docx parsing library
# Pillow==10.0.0       # For image processing
# pypandoc==1.11       # For additional format conversions
# markdown==3.4.4      # For markdown processing
